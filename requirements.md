# STUDYBUDDY

Studybuddy is a personal conversational buddy with audio capabilities who talks back to me, explains concepts and recognizes interupts when I start speaking. Everything runs locally without requiring any API keys from larger LLMs, just by using available libraries.

Studybuddy will have a simple user desktop interface.

I would also love the capability of uploading a document and have studybuddy discuss the contents with me, asking me questions and quizing me based off of the content of the material.
