# Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing systems that can learn from and make decisions based on data. These systems can improve their performance over time as they are exposed to more data.

## Types of Machine Learning

### Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from labeled training data. The system makes predictions based on evidence in the presence of uncertainty.

Example algorithms include:

- Linear Regression
- Support Vector Machines
- Neural Networks
- Decision Trees

### Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning is where the algorithm learns patterns from unlabeled data. The system tries to learn the patterns and the underlying structure from the input data.

Example algorithms include:

- Clustering
- Anomaly Detection
- Neural Networks (self-organizing maps)
- Dimensionality Reduction

### Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning is about taking suitable actions to maximize rewards in a particular situation. It differs from supervised learning in that correct input/output pairs are never presented.

## Applications of Machine Learning

Machine learning has many applications in modern technology, including:

1. Image and Speech Recognition
2. Medical Diagnosis
3. Financial Market Analysis
4. Recommendation Systems
5. Natural Language Processing

## Basic Terminology

- **Feature**: An individual measurable property of the phenomenon being observed.
- **Model**: A mathematical representation of a real-world process.
- **Training**: The process of determining the ideal parameters comprising a model.
- **Inference**: Using the trained model to make predictions.
- **Overfitting**: When a model learns the training data too well, including noise and outliers.
- **Underfitting**: When a model is too simple to capture the underlying trend of the data.

Understanding these basic concepts is crucial for diving deeper into machine learning algorithms and applications.
